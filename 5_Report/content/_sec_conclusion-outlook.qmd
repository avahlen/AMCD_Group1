## Conclusion  
This project took us from a theorectical modelling of the filter with transfer functions, to the first five-transistor prototype through two
reference designs by Prof.&nbsp;Pretl and, finally, to a home-grown
“advanced” OTA driving a gm-C biquad filter. Each stage exposed new
technical and organisational lessons:

* **Prototype OTA** – The minimalist 5-T cell we drew in Xschem was the first design with a many errors which took us a lot of time but at the same time gained experience, Debugging it forced us to master hierarchical netlisting, ac analysis, and transient smoke tests.

* **Pretl’s 5-T and Improved OTAs** – Simulating well-characterised reference
  circuits revealed why proper cascode biasing and common-mode regulation matter.  Working with the lecture notes sharpened our intuition for $g_m/I_D$ trade-offs.

* **Advanced OTA & gm-C biquad** – Armed with that insight we sized a new OTA,
  embedded four copies in a Baker-style biquad, and verified low-pass behaviour
  in Ngspice. Although the filter has yet to reach textbook performance
  (excess capacitor area and modest accuracy), the core transconductor
  operated as intended and the full design flow—from Docker setup to AC without critical errors.

Beyond the circuits themselves we tackled practical IC-flow hurdles:
absolute path handling inside Docker, strict symbol classification,
plain-text netlist debugging, and (just as important) team communication.
Working through those issues was as valuable as the schematics we produced.

## Outlook
The current prototype still relies on 20–40 nF capacitor plates, far too large.
Once the schematic is frozen, a full Monte-Carlo corner run is required to quantify flicker-noise density, device mismatch, and the benefits of common-centroid placement. Replacing the external Ibias source with a compact current-reference DAC would move all frequency control on-chip and simplifying future integrator arrays.

The final stretch for the gm-C biquad, will be physical-verification work: schematic-versus-layout checks and migration of the Docker flow to the PDK’s official calibre or klayout rule decks. With only modest additional simulation and layout effort, the design can mature into a fabrication-ready 1 kHz low-pass gm-C biquad—a useful test vehicle for our newly-acquired analog-IC skills and a solid springboard for more ambitious mixed-signal projects.

As the layout of the 5T-OTA is finished, the next steps are the import of the 5T-OTA Cell into the top-level layout. This can easily be achieved, as KLayout provides and import function, that was already tested. 
The design of the top-level should include the resistors and capacitors needed for the biquad. In addition, bonding pads need to be placed to connect the layout to a pin of the chosen package. 
LVS in the top-level will be a challenge, as the exported netlist must account for the hierarchy of the schematic. This will also extend the time needed to run the LVS-script. 
When the top-level is layouted, the remaining density DRC-violations need to be addressed. As the layout should be complete at this point this can be done by the fill tool provided in KLayout. 
In total only a little more work needs to be done on the layout, to get ready for an eventual tape out.
