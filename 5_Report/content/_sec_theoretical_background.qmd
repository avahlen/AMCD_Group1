# Theoretical Background

my idea was to group all theoretics into one chapter, like a when the information becomes necessary during the quarto book, people can just jump back to this. we would circumvent having to introduce every little concept seperately whenever it comes up...

## Operational Amplifier

i think this is kinda where our focus is again, so like a good theory is necessary

### Current Mirror

we talked a lot about the stages during the lectures, so i thought good idea to introduce them seperatly 

### Differential Stage

both of them (and then maybe? slot them together, could be ddone in varients???)

### Variants ?

maybe like miller opamp or something like that

### Small-Signal Representation

thought i would be a good idea to at least have this somewhere

### Stability

stability of op amp on its own

### Sizing

dont know if it makes sense here, i think at some theoretics should be written about sizing, but open to discuss placement

## Biquad

theoretical background on biquad, there are some ressources from AMCD aulis about this, just want introduction on what excatly this filter ist



### Characteristics

characteristics of design, implementation etc. lets see what we can find

do we  need behauviour here too?

### Stability

stability of biquad as a whole
