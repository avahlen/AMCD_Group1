# Theoretical Background

my idea was to group all theoretics into one chapter, like a when the information becomes necessary during the quarto book, people can just jump back to this. we would circumvent having to introduce every little concept seperately whenever it comes up...

:::{.callout-warning}
I am thinking about changing the order, so that we are starting with biquads and work through the filter design from big to small...
:::

This chapter introduces the theory and core concepts necessary for IC design of a biquad filter. It is structured in a way, that it goes from the big picture to the small components. First, biquad filters are introduced with a focus on the universal biquad filter. After that, operational amplifiers come into the the foreground, as biquad filters make use of them in their circuits. Operational amplifiers are looked upon from an IC design standpoint.

## Biquad filter

The biquadratic filter, also known as the biquad filter, has its earliest implementation in the 1960s but is still in use today, most commonly in radio frequency receivers [@razavi2018]. In its application in RF-technology, it is used to remove unwanted neighboring signals ans noise [@razavi2024]. As biquad filter are second-order filters, they are also used as building blocks for higher filter implementations, by cascading them and adding first order filters [@aslkpro2012].

### Universal biquad filter

For the filter design in this project, an universal biquad filter is used. The universal biquad filter is biquad filter variant with four operational amplifiers used in its design and the property of being able to be used in four different filter variants. Depending on the output of the universal biquad used, a low pass filter, high pass filter, band pass filter, or band stop filter will be implemented. This can be seen in (ref to figure of biquad fitler design). [@aslkpro2012]

The universal biquad filter consists of two non-inverting amplifiers working as adders in the circuit and two integrators. By setting $R$ and $C$ to specific values, the resonance frequency can be chosen. Other parameters adjustable in the universal biquad filter are the quality factor $Q$ and the low-frequency gain $H_0$. The quality factor and low-frequency gain determine the frequency response peaks of the low pass filter and the band pass filter. [@aslkpro2012]

### Characteristics

NOTE: no more than 3 subsections!

As the universal biquad filter is a second order filter with the specified outputs low pass, high pass, band pass, and band stop, each filter option can be described with a tranfer function on system level. The general second order transfer function is:

$$
H(s) = \frac{a_1 s^2 + b_1 s + c_1}{a_2 s^2 + b_2 s + c_2}
$$ {#eq-TFSecondOrder}

The coeffcients can be choosen so, that different responses, like low pass, high pass, band pass, and band stop are achieved.

In filter design a variant of this generalized transfer function is often choosen because it is easier describe the system by quality factor and angular frequency. @eq-TFSecondOrderBiquad is an exemplatory low pass filter with a transfer function specified for filter design. [@razavi2018]

$$
H(s) = \frac{\omega_n^2}{s^2 + \frac{\omega_n}{Q} s + \omega_n^2}
$$ {#eq-TFSecondOrderBiquad}

$Q$ determines amoung other things the amount of peaking the transfer function has at the chosen frequency. @lst-lowPassDifferentQ shows this graphically, the amout of peaking increases with increasing quality factor $Q$.

The height of the peak can be calculated with:

$$
A_{peak} = \frac{Q}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4Q^2}}}
$$ {#eq-calculatePeak}

For $Q = 100$ the peak is $A_{peak} = 100.001$, which converted into dB is $A_{peak,dB} = 40\,dB$, as is shown in @fig-lowPassDifferentQ.





## Operational Amplifier
As seen in @fig-BiquadCircuit a Biquad Filter consists four Operational Amplifiers. To get a better understanding of these, this chaper will discuss the main arguments of OPAMS.
There are different types of operational amplifiers that differ, for example, by their low- or high-impedance inputs and outputs. According to Schmid there exist nine diffrent types of the Opamps, but only four are mainly used [@Approximating_OPAMP]. This is because almost always, the non-inverting (positive) input is designed as a high-impedance voltage input. The inverting (negative) input can either be a high-impedance voltage input or a low-impedance current input, depending on the type. Accordingly, the output can be either a low-impedance voltage output or a high-impedance current output. 
This results in four basic configurations, as shown in the accompanying table @tbl-opamp_comapre.

As a general rule, the simplest circuit that can do a job is usually the best choice. [@hpretlacd]

### Voltage-Feedback Amplifiers (VFA)
When discussing operational amplifiers (OPAMPs), most sources refer to the Voltage-Feedback Amplifier. These VFAs are **voltage-controlled voltage sources**, essentially acting as voltage boosters. They are characterized by a high-impedance input for both the non-inverting and inverting terminals, and a low-impedance voltage output. To realize various desired circuits, such as amplification, integration, addition/subtraction, etc..., these functions should ideally be achieved only through the surrounding circuitry. To meet this requirement, three main requirements need be satisfied:

- **Extremely High Voltage Gain**: Typically ranging from 60 to 120 dB (or a gain factor of $10^4$ to $10^6$), this gain should be available over a wide frequency range.
- **High Impedance at Differential Inputs**: Ensuring minimal loading of the signal source.
- **Low Impedance at the Output**: Allowing the amplifier to drive various loads without significant voltage drop.


::: {.callout-important}
## Difference between a voltage source and a current source 
**Voltage source**  
A voltage source creates a constant voltage output by changing the output. 

**Current source** 
A current source creates a constant current by changing the voltage

Both of this sources can be explained by Ohms-Law: $R = \frac{U}{I}$. For example the voltage source: There is no influence of the load, so $R$ may change and its value is unknown to the source. So to keep the voltage stable we can only change the current.

### Operational Transconductance Amplifier (OTA)
In the design process of the biquad only OTAs will be used, so the focus of this chapter will be on them. The operational transconductance amplifier puts out out a current proportional to its input voltage, unlike Voltage-Feedback Amplifiers REF:KAPITEL_VFA. In other words an OTA is a **voltage controlled current source**. 

![Schematic symbol of an OTA @book-rotaktivefilter](../images/sec_theorectical_background/ota_symbol.png){#fig-otasym}

As seen in the figure @fig-otasym the OTA has the two differental inputs and the current output. On top of that it has a biasing current input $I_{bias}$ which can control the 

#### Transconductance

Transconductance is a fundamental parameter that describes the relationship between the input voltage and the output current in electronic devices, particularly in transistors and vacuum tubes. It is defined as the ratio of the change in output current to the change in input voltage, under conditions where all other variables are held constant. Mathematically, it is expressed as:

\[ g_m = \frac{\Delta I_{out}}{\Delta V_{in}} \]

where \( g_m \) is the transconductance, \( \Delta I_{out} \) is the change in output current, and \( \Delta V_{in} \) is the change in input voltage. The unit of transconductance is the siemens (S), which is equivalent to amperes per volt (A/V). Historically, it was also measured in "mhos," which is "ohm" spelled backwards, reflecting its inverse relationship to resistance.

The term "transconductance" originates from the concept of "transfer conductance." It combines the ideas of "transfer," indicating the transfer of a signal from the input to the output, and "conductance," which is the reciprocal of resistance and measures how easily a material conducts electric current. In essence, transconductance quantifies how effectively a device can convert a voltage change at its input into a proportional current change at its output.

Transconductance is a crucial parameter in the design and analysis of electronic circuits, especially in amplifiers. In vacuum tubes and field-effect transistors (FETs), the transconductance determines the device's ability to amplify signals. A higher transconductance value indicates a stronger amplification capability, as a small change in input voltage can result in a significant change in output current. This property makes transconductance a key factor in the performance and efficiency of various electronic devices and circuits.

## MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect-Transistor )

To get a general insight how an Operational Amplifier works and to uderstand the difference between a "off th shelf" part and a self made IC-Design, its nessesary to understand the main component: The MOSFET.

To be more precise, its nesessary to understand the behaviour of a MOSFET. Since were designing one from scratch, its possible to change the width W and leght L of the pysical layout. By doing this there is a lot of room for freedom and experimental space.

### Small-Signal Representation

### Sizing 

As mentioned earlier we have several degrees of freedom in our design, like $W$, $L$, or the bias current $I_D$. 
The problem is, that its extremly complex to describe a MOSFET mathmaticly and on top to that of change values to get a desired behaviour. Glady a wide used technique, which was introduced by P. Jespers and B. Murmann, is the g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D} approach \ref{Jesper.... Pretl 3).

*Saturation* 
Saturation is a specific operation mode of a transistor. Its also called "ON mode", because a channel between drain and source is created. This state is reached when the voltage $V_DS >= (V_GS - V_th)$. When this happens the drain-source current I_DS gets stable (saturates) and becomes nearly indipendet of V_DS. Still it can be very well controlled via V_GS, due to an effect called "pinch-off" (\ref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET}).

The g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D} method is primarly inteded to be used in saturated MOSFETs. To ensure this we keep the drain-source voltage as V_ds = V_DD / 2.
