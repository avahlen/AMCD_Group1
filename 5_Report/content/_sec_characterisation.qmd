# Characterisation

this chap is more about our biquad, and how we made it the way it is now

i am failry open to discuss the exact contents of this chapter, as it is the one i am the most unsure about

we also need to excatly decide on where this chapter ends, as Finn will continue with chap 5 and the break between the chapters shall be as smooth as possible

## Behauvioral Analysis

i have no idea if this is grammatically correct, behauvior is a very hard word

### Transfer Function

the python plots based on TF from red pitaya manual

### Ideal Opamp

kinda forgot where I wanted to go with this one... ehhh maybe it will come back

uhhh i think it was about the ideal circuit and spice analysis etc

## Implementation (or Real Circuit)

this is about the transition from the ideal circuit to real circuit

### used opamp representation

like with opamp did we use specifically (5 ota i think), why, what are special about that

### Sizing

with the script from pretl, if i remember correctly
