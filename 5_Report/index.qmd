# Abstract {.unnumbered}

This project explores the IC design of a biquad filter from mathematical modelling over ideal circuit implementations to sizing and using several differnet OTAs and a concluding physical implementation of an OTA. Two different OTA models were incorporated into implementing the universal biquad filter and compared with simulations to the theoretical model. Additionally, a low pass filter was designed with a Gm-C filter to try to realise the required behauviour that way. To experience the the actual physical layouting of an IC chip, the 5T-OTA was implemented as a physical design with the help of KLayout.
