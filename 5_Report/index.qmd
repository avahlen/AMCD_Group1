# Abstract {.unnumbered}

The project combines theoretical exploration with hands-on circuit design to realise a biquad filter. Fundamental OTA concepts were first examined in mathematical modelling and later in simulation, beginning with a simple five-transistor prototype and progressing through two reference amplifiers by Prof. Pretl. Insights gained from their biasing schemes, cascode loading, and common-mode control informed the development of an advanced, in-house OTA sized via the $g_m/I_D$ methodology for strong-inversion operation. Four identical instances of this custom cell were then assembled into a Baker-style biquad and verified in Xschem and Ngspice for AC behaviour. Additionally, the 5T-OTA was implemented as a physical design with the help of KLayout.
