The project combines theoretical exploration with hands-on circuit design to realise a fully differential biquad low-pass filter. Fundamental OTA concepts were first examined in simulation, beginning with a simple five-transistor prototype and progressing through two reference amplifiers by Prof. Prettl. Insights gained from their biasing schemes, cascode loading, and common-mode control informed the development of an advanced, in-house OTA sized via the $g_m/I_D$ methodology for strong-inversion operation. Four identical instances of this custom cell were then assembled into a Baker-style biquad and verified in Xschem and Ngspice for both small-signal and large-signal behaviour. The workflow—from schematic capture and hierarchical netlisting to AC, transient, and unity-gain testing—establishes a reproducible path that balances analytical sizing with practical simulation. Remaining steps include corner and noise analysis, and layout verification, setting the stage for a future silicon implementation and providing a transferable methodology for mixed-signal IC design.
